# Everest Cookie Policy

**Last Updated: May 2023**

## Introduction

This Cookie Policy explains how Everest App, Inc. ("Company," "we," or "us") uses cookies and similar technologies to recognize you when you use our mobile application ("App"). It explains what these technologies are and why we use them, as well as your rights to control our use of them.

## What Are Cookies?

Cookies are small data files that are placed on your device when you use an app or visit a website. Cookies are widely used by app providers to make their apps work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.

## Why Do We Use Cookies?

We use cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are required for technical reasons for our App to operate, and we refer to these as "essential" or "strictly necessary" cookies. Other cookies enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our App. We also use cookies to help us compile aggregate data about App traffic and interaction so that we can offer better app experiences and tools in the future.

## Types of Cookies We Use

### Essential Cookies
These cookies are strictly necessary to provide you with services available through our App and to use some of its features, such as access to secure areas. Because these cookies are strictly necessary to deliver the App, you cannot refuse them without impacting how our App functions.

### Performance/Analytics Cookies
These cookies collect information that is used either in aggregate form to help us understand how our App is being used or how effective our marketing campaigns are, or to help us customize our App for you. If you do not allow these cookies, we will not know when you have used our App.

### Functionality Cookies
These cookies allow our App to remember choices you make when you use our App. The purpose of these cookies is to provide you with a more personal experience and to avoid you having to re-select your preferences every time you use the App.

### Targeting/Advertising Cookies
These cookies are used to make advertising messages more relevant to you and your interests. They also perform functions like preventing the same ad from continuously reappearing, ensuring that ads are properly displayed, and in some cases selecting advertisements that are based on your interests.

## Mobile Device Identifiers

In the mobile environment, we or our third-party partners may use mobile device identifiers (such as Apple's IDFA or Google's Advertising ID) instead of or in addition to cookies. These identifiers perform many of the same functions as cookies, such as allowing us to identify your device and track your behavior for advertising and analytics purposes.

## How Can You Control Cookies?

You have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies. You can exercise your cookie preferences through your device settings.

### Mobile Device Settings
- **iOS Devices**: Go to "Settings" > "Privacy" > "Advertising" > Enable "Limit Ad Tracking"
- **Android Devices**: Go to "Settings" > "Google" > "Ads" > Enable "Opt out of Ads Personalization"

Please note that if you choose to reject cookies, you may not be able to use the full functionality of our App.

## Third-Party Cookies

In addition to our own cookies, we may also use various third-party cookies to report usage statistics of the App, deliver advertisements, and so on. These third-party providers may include:

- **Analytics providers** (such as Google Analytics)
- **Advertising networks**
- **Social media platforms**

Each of these third-party providers is subject to its own privacy and cookie policies.

## Updates to This Cookie Policy

We may update this Cookie Policy from time to time in order to reflect, for example, changes to the cookies we use or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. Please therefore re-visit this Cookie Policy regularly to stay informed about our use of cookies and related technologies.

The date at the top of this Cookie Policy indicates when it was last updated.
